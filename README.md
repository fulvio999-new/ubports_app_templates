# ubports_app_templates

A set of Ubuntu Touch (UBports) templates/skeleton Application created to speed up the developments of new applications.
You can create a new application using one of them as starting point.

**FOR DETAILS SEE 'Doc' FOLDER INSIDE THE PROJECT**

Currently all the templates are “pure-qml-cmake - Pure QML App (built using Cmake)” 
(ie: qml+javascript based)

There are four templates: 
**- AdaptiveLayout:** to create an application based on the AdaptiveLayout Component
**- ChartJs:** to create an application that include chart creation using a javascript library
**- ListView:** to create an application that uses a ListView component (UbuntuListView) to show a list of items and PageStack for navigation
**- PageStack:**  to create an application that uses PageStack component for pages navigation


**Requirements:**

To use this template is necessary install the **“cookiecutter”** library (https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

After the installation will be available the executable ‘cookiecutter’ from the command line.

Also the  installation of ‘clickable’  tool is nesessary (http://clickable.bhdouglass.com/en/latest/).
It is not mandatory to create new applications from the templates but will be necessary to continue the development of your new application.

**How to use the templates:**
1) donwload/clone the project (git clone https://github.com/fulvio999/ubports_app_templates.git)
2) open a shell in the folder where you want create your new application
3) run the following command:

$ cookiecutter "path to cookiecutter.json"

Where “path to cookiecutter.json” is the path to “cookiecutter.json ”file of the chosen template.

4) provide the required informations (press enter to use default proposed values)

At the end, your new application will be placed in a folder whose name is the value provided for “project_name” entry.

**Testing:**
Note: ‘clickable’ tool is necessary to perform this task
To test your new application, enter in his root folder (here you’ll find a file named ‘clickable.json’)
open a shell in that folder and run:

$ clickable desktop

If everything is ok, after a while your new application will start.

Now you are ready to start your new application development.

**Of course the qml files name used in the templates (eg Page, Components id, Components names...) are generic. You can customize,rename, adpat them in the generated Application**
